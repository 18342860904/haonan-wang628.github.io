 I'm a first-year undergraduate student and to study at [Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Science (MSE)](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/graduate-studies/mse-programs/)from [Whiting School of Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/)，and MSE's Research Concentration: Human Language Technology
 
 Prior to JHU, I had completed an undergraduate comprehensive program in Mathematic，information and Computing Science at 
 [Liaoning Technical University](http://lxy.lntu.edu.cn/)， and graduated.And I received my Bachelor's Degree in information and Computing Science at Liaoning Technical University from China.During my undergraduate study, I studied and worked at the Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science and Institute of Machine Learning and Data Mining for four years, and served as the team leader of the Math819 College Student Competition，where I was joint guided by [Wei Liu](http://lxy.lntu.edu.cn/info/1068/2235.htm)， [Fanhui Zeng](http://lxy.lntu.edu.cn/info/1068/2232.htm)and[Yu Zhang](http://lxy.lntu.edu.cn/info/1068/2242.htm)，

Past Research Direction

#1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
#1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
#1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your #GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
#1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what #files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
#1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub #username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
#1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

#Site-wide configuration
#------
#T#he main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml]#(https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide #features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for #the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For #example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

#Create content & metadata
#------
#For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, #_teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory]#(https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about #the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on #the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for #specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk]##(https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file]#(https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of #the _talks directory).
