 I'm a graduate student and to study at [Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Science (MSE)](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/graduate-studies/mse-programs/)from [Whiting School of Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/)， and MSE's Research Concentration: Human Language Technology
 
 Prior to JHU, I had completed an undergraduate comprehensive program in Mathematic， information, and Computing Science at 
 [Liaoning Technical University](http://lxy.lntu.edu.cn/)， and graduated. I received my Bachelor's in Information and Computing Science at Liaoning Technical University in China. During my undergraduate study, I studied and worked at the Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science and the Institute of Machine Learning and Data Mining for four years, and served as the team leader of the Math819 College Student Competition， where I was jointly guided by [Wei Liu](http://lxy.lntu.edu.cn/info/1068/2235.htm)， [Fanhui Zeng](http://lxy.lntu.edu.cn/info/1068/2232.htm)and[Yu Zhang](http://lxy.lntu.edu.cn/info/1068/2242.htm)，
